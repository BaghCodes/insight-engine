# InsightEngine

## Summary

InsightEngine is a full-stack RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) platform built with React.js, FastAPi and Python that enables secure, offline document querying and analysis, processing formats like PDF, DOCX, and XLSX to deliver intelligent insights without external dependencies.

## Problem Definition
Job seekers and professionals often struggle with analyzing diverse documents (e.g., resumes, reports) efficiently, facing issues like privacy concerns, slow processing, and lack of intelligent querying, leading to time-consuming manual reviews and missed opportunities in competitive fields like software engineering.
I built a Python-centric backend for AI processing integrated with a React frontend for user interaction: started with document parsing in Python, added vector embeddings for search, implemented LLM handling, and structured the UI with React components for uploads and chats.
